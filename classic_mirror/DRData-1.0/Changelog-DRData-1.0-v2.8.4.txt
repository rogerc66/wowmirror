Updated for 5.3.


--------------------

Adirelle:
	- Forgot to bump the minor number.
slaren:
	- updated toc, fixed glyph of blinding light spellid, added symbiosis versions of solar beam, grapple weapon, intimidating roar, hammer of justice, entangling roots, frost nova, cyclone (most untested)
Cybeloras:
	- Looks like Seduce and Mesmerize really are on the fear DR (from the AJ thread)
	- Seduction and Mesmerize are Disorients, not fears (from the AJ thread)
